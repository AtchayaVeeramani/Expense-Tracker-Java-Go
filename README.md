Expense Tracker Backend
This is the backend service for an Expense Tracker application, built using Java 21 and Spring Boot 3. It provides RESTful API endpoints to manage expenses.

Project Overview
The Expense Tracker backend allows users to create, read, update, and delete expense records. This initial version features:

A working REST API endpoint to fetch a list of expenses.

Uses Java 21 and Spring Boot 3 for modern, maintainable code.

Designed to be easily extendable with database integration and additional features.

Ready for integration with frontend apps or microservices written in other languages.

Development Process
1. Environment Setup
Installed Java 21 JDK and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.

Configured VS Code for Java development.

Initialized the project with Gradle and Spring Boot 3.

2. Creating the Basic Application
Created BackendApplication.java as the main Spring Boot app launcher.

Verified the app runs successfully with embedded Tomcat server.

3. Building the Expense Model
Developed Expense.java class to represent expense data structure:

Fields: id (Long), title (String), amount (Double), date (LocalDate).

Included constructors, getters, and setters.

4. Developing the Expense Controller
Created ExpenseController.java with:

Annotation @RestController.

Endpoint @GetMapping("/expenses") returning a list of sample expenses as JSON.

Tested endpoint locally at http://localhost:8080/expenses until it returned expected JSON data.

5. Troubleshooting & Fixes
Resolved common issues such as:

Matching class names and filenames (singular Expense used consistently).

Restarting Spring Boot after code changes.

Killing previous processes blocking port 8080.

Fixing 404 errors by ensuring correct package structure and annotations.

6. Version Control
Saved the project regularly.

Used Git and GitHub Desktop to commit and push code after significant changes.

Updated this README file to document project progress and endpoint usage.

Response Example:

json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Coffee",
    "amount": 2.5,
    "date": "2025-08-05"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Book",
    "amount": 15,
    "date": "2025-08-05"
  }
]
Future Improvements
Add database persistence using Spring Data JPA and H2/MySQL.

Expand CRUD operations (POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints).

Implement validation, authentication, and error handling.

Integrate analytics microservice built with Go.

Build a user-friendly frontend to interact with the backend.
